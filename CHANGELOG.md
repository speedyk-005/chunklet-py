## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-06

### Added

- **CLI Multiple Input Files:** Added an `--input-files` argument to allow processing of multiple specific files.
- **CLI Metadata Flag:** Added a `-m, --metadata` flag to the CLI to display chunk metadata in the output.
- **Document Chunker:** Introduced `DocumentChunker` to handle various file formats like `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.rst`, `.rtf`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, and `.csv`.
- **Show Progress Parameter:** Added `show_progress` parameter to `batch_chunk` in `PlainTextChunker` to allow users to control the display of the progress bar.
- **Custom Processors:** Introduced support for custom document processors, allowing users to define their own logic for extracting text from various file types.
- **Test Coverage:** Improved test coverage for `PlainTextChunker`.
- **Custom Exception Types:** Introduced `FileProcessingError` for errors during file reading/processing and `UnsupportedFileTypeError` for unsupported file formats.

### Changed

- **Dependency Versioning:** Updated `pyproject.toml` to include minimum version specifiers (`>=`) for all project dependencies, ensuring better reproducibility and stability.
- **Linting:** Integrated `flake8` for code linting and updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with instructions for running it.
- **Code Quality:** Fixed various `pyflakes` linting issues across the `src/` and `tests/` directories, improving code cleanliness.
- **Error Handling:** Renamed `TokenNotProvidedError` to `TokenCounterMissingError` for clearer semantics and updated all relevant usages.
- **Project Restructuring:**
    - Renamed `src/chunklet/core.py` to `src/chunklet/plain_text_chunker.py`.
    - Renamed `Chunklet` class to `PlainTextChunker`.
- **Friendlier Initialization:** Updated `PlainTextChunker` to accept a a list of dict instead of a list of models for more beginner friendly initialization.
- **Safer Tokenizer Command processing:** Changed `shell=True` to `shell=False` for the subprocess.run call in create_external_tokenizer for enhanced security and predictability. The shlex module is now implicitly used for command parsing when shell=False.
- **Improved chunking format:** Added a newline between sentences for structured chunking format output. This helps preserving original format better.
- **Performance Improvement:** Refactored `_group_by_chunk` in `PlainTextChunker` to use incremental token recalculation for better performance.

- **Project Layout:** Restructured project by moving the logo to the root and adding a `samples/` directory to store the sample files.
- **CLI Aliases:** Added `-f` as an alias for `--file` and `-d` as an alias for `--input-dir`.
- **Default Limits:** Changed the default `max_tokens` from 512 to 256 and `max_sentences` from 100 to 12.


### Removed

- **CLI Argument:** Removed the deprecated `--batch` argument.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added

- **CLI Version Flag:** Implemented a `--version` flag to display the package version.
- **Version Attribute:** Added `__version__` to the `__init__.py` file.
- **CLI Directory Input:** Batch processing now supports reading input from a directory (`--input-dir`), automatically discovering `.txt` and `.md` files.
- **CLI Flexible Output:** Chunks can now be written to a specified output directory (`--output-dir`), with each chunk saved as a separate file (e.g., `filename_chunk_1.txt`).
- **CLI Input File Alias:** Added `--input-file` as an alias for `--file` for consistency with `--input-dir`.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-21

### Added

- **Custom Sentence Splitters:** Added support for integrating custom sentence splitting functions, allowing users to define their own logic for specific languages or requirements.
- **Robust fallback splitter:** Switched to a simpler, more robust and predictable sentence splitter fallback. Reduced over splitting and merging.  
- **Custom Exception Types:** Introduced `ChunkletError`, `InvalidInputError`, and `TokenNotProvidedError` for more specific and robust error handling across the library.
- **Progress Bar for Batch Processing**: Visual feedback for batch processing with a `rich` progress bar.
- **Faster batching**: On `n_jobs=1`, mpire is not used to prevent overheads. on `n_jobs>=2` batch are process with group of 2 per process. 

### Changed

- **Fault-Tolerant Batch Processing**: In batch mode, if a task fails, `chunklet` will now stop processing and return the results of the tasks that completed successfully, preventing wasted work.
- **_get_overlap_clauses Logic:** Simplified the logic for calculating overlap clauses by filtering empty clauses and improving the capitalization check.
- **Improved fallback splitter:** Used `p{Lu}`, `p{Ll}` in `regex_splitter.py` to identify and handle abbreviations and acronyms more accurately across different languages.                
- **Token Counter Error Handling:** Enhanced robustness by introducing a helper method to safely count tokens and handle potential errors from user-provided token counters. On error, operation is aborted.
- **LRU Cache Optimization:** Increased `lru_cache` maxsize from 25 to 256 for improved caching performance.
- **`preview_sentences` Enhanced Output:** The `preview_sentences` function now returns a tuple containing the list of sentences and any warnings encountered during processing, allowing for better insight into potential issues.
  
### Fixed

- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Addressed an `IndexError` in overlap calculation and other bugs.


## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- **Custom Tokenizer Command:** Introduced a `--tokenizer-command` CLI argument to allow users to define a custom shell command for token counting.

### Changed

- **Parallel Processing Implementation:** Replaced `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` with `mpire` for batch processing, leveraging true multiprocessing for improved performance.
- **Fallback Splitter Enhancement:** Improved the fallback splitter logic  to split more logically and handle more edge cases. That ensure about 18.2 % more accuracy.
- **Language Detection Refinement:** detect_text_language now internally trims the ranked results to the top 10 candidates and uses a more stable normalization method, improving accuracy and reliability for ambiguous or short texts.
- **Simplified & Smarter Grouping Logic**: Simplified the grouping logic by eliminating unnecessary steps. The algorithm now split sentence further into clauses to ensure more logical overlap calculation and balanced groupings. The original formatting of the text is prioritized.
- **Default Overlap Percentage:** Increased the default `overlap_percent` from 10% to 20% for `chunk`, `_chunk`, and `_chunk_cached` methods to ensure consistency.
- **Regex Pattern Construction:** Replaced string concatenation with f-strings for creating regex patterns to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Refactoring** Refactored some logics to be more concise in the codebase.
- **Documentation:** Improved code clarity by enhancing docstrings and adding more comments throughout the codebase. Updated the `README.md` with a new table of contents, revised examples, and other improvements.
- **Enhanced Verbosity:** Emits a higher number of logs when `verbose` is set to true to improve traceability.
- **Aggregated Logging:** Warnings from parallel processing runs are now aggregated and displayed with a repetition count for better readability.
- **Testing:** Improved the test suite by prioritizing quality over quantity, resulting in more robust and meaningful tests.

### Removed
