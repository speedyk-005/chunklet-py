-   :material-file-document-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Document Chunker__

    ---

    Transforms plain text and diverse document formats (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.epub`, `.txt`, `.tex`, `.html`, `.hml`, `.md`, `.rst`, `.rtf`, `.odt`, `.csv`, and `.xlsx`) into perfectly sized, context-aware chunks with flexible constraint-based chunking and intelligent overlap for optimal LLM and embedding performance.

    Perfect for RAG systems, document analysis, and any workflow that needs smart text segmentation with full control over chunk sizes.
