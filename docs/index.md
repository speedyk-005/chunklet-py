## What is Chunklet, Anyway? (And Why Should You Care?)

So, you've got a mountain of text and a tiny little pickaxe? Fear not! You've stumbled upon the official (and slightly quirky) documentation for **Chunklet-py**, your new heavy machinery for demolishing text into perfectly sized, context-aware chunks. 

At its core, Chunklet is a smart text chunking utility. Whether you're preparing data for Large Language Models (LLMs), building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, or just need to break down a long document, Chunklet has your back. It handles the messy business of text segmentation so you don't have to.

Chunklet is a Python library for multilingual, context-aware text chunking optimized for large language model (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. It splits long documents into manageable segments while preserving semantic boundaries, enabling efficient indexing, embedding, and inference.

## Did You Know?

> **üí° Tip:** Chunklet's `overlap_percent` works at the *clause level*, not just sentence or token boundaries! This means it intelligently preserves semantic flow across chunks, making your LLMs smarter and your RAG pipelines more effective.


## Why Bother with Fancy Chunking?

Look, you *could* just split your text by character count or paragraphs. But let's be honest, that's like performing surgery with a butter knife. Standard splitting methods often:

-   **Commit literary butchery:** They'll chop sentences right in the middle of a thought.
-   **Get lost in translation:** They don't care about the rules of non-English languages.
-   **Have the memory of a goldfish:** They forget the context of the previous chunk, leaving you with a mess of disconnected ideas.

**Chunklet is the smart surgeon.** It understands the structure of your text, using fancy tricks like clause-level overlapping to keep the meaning intact. It's like a linguistic artist, carefully preserving the masterpiece that is your data.

## ü§î Why Chunklet?

Feature                  | Why it‚Äôs elite  
------------------------|----------------
‚õìÔ∏è **Hybrid Mode**          | Combines token + sentence limits with guaranteed overlap ‚Äî rare even in commercial stacks.  
üåê **Multilingual Fallbacks** | Pysbd > SentenceSplitter > Regex, with dynamic confidence detection.  
‚ûø **Clause-Level Overlap**   | `overlap_percent operates at the **clause level**, preserving semantic flow across chunks using logic.  
‚ö° **Parallel Batch Processing** | Efficient parallel processing with `ThreadPoolExecutor`, optimized for low overhead on small batches.  
‚ôªÔ∏è **LRU Caching**            | Smart memoization via `functools.lru_cache`.  
ü™Ñ **Pluggable Token Counters** | Swap in GPT-2, BPE, or your own tokenizer.
‚úÇÔ∏è **Pluggable Sentence splitters**  | Integrate custom splitters for more specific languages.
