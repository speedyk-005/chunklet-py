"""
Chunklet: Multi_strategy, Context-aware, Multilingual Text Chunker

This package provides a robust and flexible solution for splitting large texts
into smaller, manageable chunks. It is designed with applications like Large
Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and
other context-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in mind.

The core functionality is provided by the `Chunklet` class, which can be
imported directly from the package alongside execptions and schemas models.
