# what we have done
- Modified `_count_tokens` to return `CallbackExcecutionError` instead of `ChunkletError`.
- **Sentence Splitting Logic:** The core sentence splitting logic, including language-specific algorithms, custom splitter integration, and fallback mechanisms, has been consolidated into a dedicated SentenceSplitter module for improved modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
- restructure the libs template
