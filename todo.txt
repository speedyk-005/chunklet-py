- add support for multiple dir in cli
- rm path from returning in validated path
- allow any iterable instead of list for all public batch methods
- update preview sentences
- add a preview text in document chunker
- change cache from 256 to 50 to prevent bloating memory




- add test for
# If curr_chunk contains only the base but limit is reached
                # That might mean a long text without punctuation.
                if chunk_base_count == sentence_count:
                    sent_head = (
                        # Ignore last chars
                        sentences[index][:100]
                        + self.continuation_marker
                    )
                    curr_chunk.append(sent_head)
                    index += 1
                    continue

- **Memory Friendly caching:** Replaced `functools.lrucache` with `cachetools.cache` to avoid instance references in cache keys to prevent unnecessary memory retention.
- Improves the exception hierarchy by removing `MissingTokenCounterError` as subclass of `InvalidInputError`.
- **Batch Chunking Flexibility:** Modified `PlainTextChunker.batch_chunk` to accept any `Iterable` of  strings for the `texts` parameter, instead of being  restricted to `list`. Improved input validation for `texts` to provide clearer error messages. 
- **Python 3.8 Support:** Dropped official support for Python 3.8. The minimum required Python version is now 3.9.
- and the other improvements
- **Faster Language Detection** Use only the first 500 characters of the text provided for faster language detection.
