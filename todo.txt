# documentation
- highlight code line in docs
- update the chunk and bastch chunk return type in the docs
- add instalation link or code block at top for each chunker


- in visualization, use argparse to support bash arg as token counter with the help of the cli cmd to tk
- add a chunk vizualizer
- replace mimetypes by content_types in vizualizer


# what we have done
- Integrated charset-normalizer for intelligent text encoding detection in code and document processing, improving reliability by correctly reading files regardless of their encoding instead of assuming UTF-8.
- We added the decorator separation test to prevent regression of the bug where decorators could be separated from their associated functions during code chunking, ensuring proper semantic preservation of Python code structure.

# done, not yet changelog
