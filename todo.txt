# what we have done


# done, not yet changelog
- Fix a bug in code chunker where line de-annotation logic was called twice, once in regex substitution and a string slice. That might cause ghost chunking bugs. we keep the regex one
- set include_comments to True by default
- fix a late-binding problem by chaninging pattern.sub(lambda match: self._annotate_block(tag, match), code) by pattern.sub(lambda match, tag=tag: self._annotate_block(tag, match), code)
- plus some other code cleaning
